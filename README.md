# PRODIGY_CS_01
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of a text by a specified number of positions down the alphabet. Users can input a message and a shift value to either encrypt or decrypt the text. The program features two main functions: one for encryption, which shifts each letter by the given shift value, and another for decryption, which reverses the shift. Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
